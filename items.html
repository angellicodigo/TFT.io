      <h3 id="mom">Mask of Madness gives bonus attack speed, which increase damage per second and mana gain. In cost, the user won't be able to cast their ability. At first it sounds bad, but this item is very useful for passive only units like luna/lightblade knight and troll warlord/berserker, since they are damaging units and they don't have abilites. Also sniper is a good choice, since he has high damage but low attack speed, and his ability shows him down.</i></h3>
